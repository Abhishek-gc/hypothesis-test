# Hypothesis Testing in Python

**1_CLT.ipynb:** This notebook demonstrates how the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** can be used to estimate the average delivery time for orders in an e-commerce company, even when the raw data is highly skewed. The analysis includes:

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulates delivery times with a mix of normal and delayed orders.
2. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Simulation**: Repeatedly samples the data to show how sample means form a normal distribution.
3. **Confidence Interval Calculation**: Computes a 95% confidence interval for the true average delivery time.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses Plotly to create interactive graphs for better understanding.

**2_HypothesisTests.ipynb:** This notebook provides a practical guide to hypothesis testing, covering key statistical tests like t-tests, z-tests, A/B testing, chi-square tests, and ANOVA. Each test is explained with real-world examples, step-by-step calculations, and Python code snippets to help you apply these concepts in data analysis.

### Tests Covered
1. **t-Test**: Compare means of two groups (e.g., sales performance of two products).
2. **z-Test**: Compare a sample mean to a population mean (e.g., battery lifespan claims).
3. **A/B Test**: Compare two versions of a product or campaign (e.g., email subject lines).
4. **Chi-Square Test**: Analyze relationships between categorical variables (e.g., product preferences by region).
5. **ANOVA**: Compare means of three or more groups (e.g., effectiveness of multiple treatments).
